The above returns true, for sure.  Enter 2017, where HR professionals still copy and paste from this spredsheet to that spredsheet  Where templates are all manually filled in.  Where offer letters take hours to generate and we count using our fingers to figure out how long a person's parental leave should be.  These are just a couple of the things that many HR professionals are not doing effectively.
