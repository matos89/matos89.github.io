I started off in retail when I was pretty young, maybe 16.  Come college, I thought retail would be my career because I had been doing it for so long.  Macy's offered me a sales manager position my junior year of college, so I took it - it seemed lik the sensible thing to do.  Nope.  It was a tough job and having to literally be on your knees while in a suit, stocking shoes in the back just wasn't working for me.  

Fast forward, I got a receptionist job at a startup, moved up to employee experience (culture & facilities), and then finally moved into HR.  Once there, I realized the HR function has some incredibly outdated and error-prone processes and is in dire need of automation.  I started to automate things here and there with bits and pieces of code I picked up from Google.  I realized I was decent at it and so here I am.
